One of the defining features of the liver is polyploidy; polyploid hepatocytes represent half of hepatocytes in humans and as many as 90% in mice. Although polyploid hepatocytes have been recognized for over 100 years, the functional role of these cells is unclear. We recently showed that regenerating polyploid hepatocytes undergo specialized cell divisions to form aneuploid daughter cells, generating a high degree of genetic diversity within the liver. Moreover, in mouse models, we found that a subset of aneuploid cells were resistant to chronic liver injury and could even promote liver regeneration. Ongoing studies in the lab investigate mechanisms that control hepatic polyploidy/aneuploidy and how these processes affect liver diseases like cancer and cirrhosis. The position involves assisting with routine laboratory tasks, including mouse colony maintenance (involving mouse handling and genotyping), housekeeping and organization, tissue sectioning and staining, molecular cloning and assisting in the design and execution of defined experiments under the guidance of a senior lab member.
